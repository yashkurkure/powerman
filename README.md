# Power Consumption of Heterogeneous Clusters of Chameleon

Chameleon is a large-scale, deeply reconfigurable experimental platform built to support Computer Sciences systems research. Chameleon is suitable for research in power consumption of heterogeneous computing systems as it supports a bare metal reconfiguration system giving users full control of the software stack including root privileges, kernel customization, and console access.
