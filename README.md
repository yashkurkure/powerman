# Power Consumption of Heterogeneous Clusters of Chameleon

Chameleon is a large-scale, deeply reconfigurable experimental platform built to support Computer Sciences systems research. Chameleon is suitable for research in power consumption of heterogeneous computing systems as it supports a bare metal reconfiguration system giving users full control of the software stack including root privileges, kernel customization, and console access.

## Chameleon reserving resources
Chameleon resources are available at multiple sites, e.g., CHI@TACC, CHI@UC, CHI@Edge. Each of the sites host their own resources for each project to use. It is possible to lease resources at each chameleon site. The maximum length of a lease is 7 days. You can find more details about reservations [here](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/reservations.html).

Once a reservation is obtained for a device, a bare metal instance can be launched with various options of images such as Ubuntu, CentOS, etc. More on launching instances and setting up ssh access can be found [here](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/baremetal.html).
